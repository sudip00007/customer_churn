#  Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**.

## tools
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, joblib)
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Dashboard: Streamlit

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model training (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
4. Model evaluation (classification report, ROC-AUC)
5. Feature importance analysis
6. Deployment-ready pipeline with saved model (`joblib`)
7. Streamlit dashboard for predictions

## Business Impact
- Helps companies identify **high churn risk customers**
- Key churn drivers: **contract type, monthly charges, tenure**
- Example: Retaining even **10% of high-risk customers** can save â‚¹X per month
